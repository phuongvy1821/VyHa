### Hi there! 😊

I am Vy Ha, a Junior at Drexel University majoring in Finance and Business Anlytics. I became interested in data analytics during my first internship at college and decided to learn programming languages to support this journey. I thought it was amazing how data can provide us with such powerful insights, enabling us to make informed and strategic decisions. 

In my freetime, I make YouTube videos 📸 and take care of my puppy 🐕
